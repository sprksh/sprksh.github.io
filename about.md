I am [Surya Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surya-prakash-a6985a61/), a Software Developer by profession. Presently working as a backend developer. Also diving into Machine Learning. An Entrepreneur.

I code in Python, Javascript and Golang.

The content in the blog are basically my random developer's notes which I made during preparing for software engineering interviews and in general to understand things in a better, deeper way. In some cases, few sentences from some sources on internet has been copied. Mostly I have tried to add the source but in some cases they might be missing.
